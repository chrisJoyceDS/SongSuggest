## Executive Summary
Our startup is poised to reshape the landscape of music discovery and appreciation. We're leveraging Spotify's Web APIs to translate songs, artists, and genres into vectors of audio track features, forming the backbone of our innovative song recommendation engine. The engine's immediate function is to provide personalized music recommendations, but we envision it as the first step towards creating a larger network of music data.

In future versions, we plan to collect user interaction data and store as submissions in a cloud hosted database. As we aggregate user identity-agnostic recommendation data and track submissions over time, we can begin to identify which track audio features are most successful. This unique insight could provide an invaluable resource for music creators, offering a fresh perspective on what works in the music industry.

Our first version solely focuses on using Spotify's track audio data and metadata to generate song recommendations. We've faced challenges due to data storage and processing limits, but our plans for scaling up include utilizing multiprocessing tools like PyTorch and Databricks, and establishing an SQL database for better data management.

For future developments, we're considering a linear regression model to predict the optimal 'distance' between songs for the best recommendation, and a genre classification model to better generalize the fluid and wide-ranging nature of music genres. We also aim to implement comprehensive unit testing and error controls for application reliability.

By harnessing the power of data, we're creating a platform that doesn't just make music more accessible to listeners, but also provides a guiding light for those creating the music of tomorrow.
