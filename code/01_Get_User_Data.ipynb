    "## Introduction\n",
    "This project evolved several times over the course of the 5 weeks we had to work on it. This Introduction is a high level overview of my plans as they evolved and ultimately how the final product came to fruition. Hopefully these sections will help the reader navigate the notebooks in a way that is readable.<br>\n",
    "`Version 1`:\n",
    "- My original idea was around collaborative filtering and creating a network based on different users data. I was planning on authenticating 3rd Party Users via Spotify Oauth, and only request access to their library, their playlists, who they followed, who followed them, and the top tracks of each other user. \n",
    "- With this information create a network with Users being the origin point, and further breaking down into nodes for Artists, Albums, Tracks, and Genres with different nodes having different metadata and descriptive data made available by Spotify. \n",
    "- With this network, calculate and manipulate song suggestions based on the mean vector of a given set of tracks depending on how you filtered the network.\n",
    "- Unfortunately, after spending several weeks exploring different articles and walkthroughs of Collaborative Filtering and working on Spotify Oauth protocols, I found out that other user data is not actually available via a user's session. <br>\n",
    "`Version 2`:\n",
    "- Having learned that gathering data from multiple users was not a possibility, I attempted to pivot to a similar form of recommendation which was Content Based Filtering. \n",
    "- While I couldn't get other users information, I could get a lot of information and track information from a given profile. This could set me up well in relation to Content Based Filtering which recommends items by comparing the content of items and their relation to a user profile. For track data this could be split between explicit, implicit, and general interactions.\n",
    "- Explicit interactions would be any tracks that a user actively saved or was one of their top tracks e.g. the frequency of play over other songs could be interpreted as liking.\n",
    "- Implicit interactions would be any tracks that a user listened to but didnt explicitly like, which came from any playlists the users owned or followed, on top of the top tracks of any artist they followed.\n",
    "- General Pool was based on songs that were available to a given user based on their current Locale/Market ('US' for example)\n",
    "- This would creat our user profile on top of the library of tracks that existed in a given users profile.\n",
    "- However, after researching a couple of articles like https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-two-approaches-of-content-based-recommendation-system-fc797460c18c and reading their notebooks, I realized:\n",
    "    - A: This wasn't exactly what I was trying to execute on which was identifying a mean vector of audio features to produce a signal of recommendations\n",
    "    - B: The techniques described weren't using any machine learning\n",
    "- Separately but in parallel, after trying to push my application code onto rendor for hosting the application, I quickly found some dependencies in relation to user authentication, redirect uris, and what streamlit/render allow within their libraries. This required me to pivot again, but in a way that I can plan for the future.<br>\n",
    "`Version 3`:\n",
    "- Create an application that doesnt authenticate 3rd Party users, but gets an access token to interact server to server. This still allows me to interact with certain API endpoints from Spotify that get tracks, audio features, artists, and genres.\n",
    "- This application will serve as a version 1 that can ultimately be built upon to create the original version down the line. Instead of pulling a user's profile, we will give the user 3 options, to get recommendations by:\n",
    "    - Track Names, Artists, Release Year\n",
    "    - Artist Names\n",
    "    - Genres\n",
    "- With each option the application would call the required endpoint to either pull the specific tracks provided by users, pull the top tracks from provided artists, pull 20 tracks per genre listed.\n",
    "- From there find the Mean Vector of the pulled track audio features, and use that mean vector to capture the closest cosine distances in relation to a scaled track data library of 400k songs.\n",
    "- There ultimately were some complications with this final version but we will get into those as the notebook progresses."

    "- After pulling some of my own user data, tracks, playlists, etc. I was able to do some EDA to identify how my music taste follows an audio track pattern/frequency across the different audio track features.\n",

    "- In either models case, none of them came close to beating the baseline score of my liked songs and songs from my profile (~75%).\n",
    "- As such, I am going back to pull even more data and try and pull as much track data as I can from one user.\n",
    "- I am going to represent a users explicit and implicit taste through:\n",
    "    - Explicit: Liked Songs, user took action on each track\n",
    "    - Explicit: Songs from playlists they created themselves or follow, user took action to make something with these songs or liked enough of the songs to follow the playlist\n",
    "    - Implicit: Songs from Artists they follow, like playlists, but users are not often the artists, and the library of songs under an Artist is more expansive than an individual playlist.\n",
    "    - Implicit: Songs from Artists who they may not follow, but have liked songs from them before\n",
    "    - General Pool: Featured Playlists and their songs which are made available by the profile\n",
    "    - General Pool: Category playlists and their songs which are made avilalbe by the profile\n",
